# Coding Challenge Week 2 Professional Portfolio
<!-- edit this form to match a readme related to this project -->

* This project was given to us at unc's bootcamp to help us consolidate our learning for weeks 1 and 2 in html, css and git. 
* This is a basic Static html webpage
* I didnt struggle much with the actual project and what it entailed. The Issue was github and the cloning process was so bugged up that I had to break down each of the pieces of starter code by cloning and copying it to a new file and attempting the push until I singled out the item causing the issue and had to get that file from a tutor. 
None the less we do have a final product and that is part of the process sometimes.

# "Sometimes you run into very strange errors that are difficult to solve and that's a part of programming sometimes. Sucks to have to deal with it" Andrew Hardemon


# Technologies Used
    HTML
    CSS

# In this code you will find a much more polished looking index.html and style.css file while getting the same results
 * There were many duplicate or redundant class tags
 * replced div with semantic html 
 * commented where I made changes (this helps a lot)
